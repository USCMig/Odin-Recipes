                    <li>First mix all the dry ingredients together in a large mixing
                        bowl.
                    </li>
                    <li>With the items in the bowl, prior to adding the water and oil
                        mix the dry ingredients around to make mixing the dough slightly
                        easier.
                    </li>
                    <li>Using your hands and/or a mixer, mix the dough until the wet
                        and dry ingredients are mixed completely.
                    </li>
                    <li>Let the dough rest for 3-5 minutes and then mix the dough again.
                        This time you'll notice that the dough's composition start to
                        change as the gluten chains are starting to form in the dough.
                    </li>
                    <li>Mix one more time after another 5-10 minutes and then let the
                        dough rest for an hour as the dough will begin to rise.
                    </li>
                    <li>Dust a working space with flour and lightly flour the outside
                        of the dough until the dough stops sticking to your fingers.
                    </li>
                    <li>work the dough by spreading it and flatten the dough by doing
                        a soft, pounding motion with a closed fist to remove any air
                        pockets that are in the dough.
                    </li>
                    <li>Take a baking sheet and lightly spray it was a canola spray. 
                        Take the dough and spread along the baking sheet, careful to not
                        stretch the dough too much in any area and tear the dough.
                    </li>
                    <li>To finish the pizza, place topping and cooke at 450 deg F for
                         15 min. or until toppings and cheese have started to attain a
                         light golden color.
